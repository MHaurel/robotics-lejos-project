# SA-project

This embedded programming project is part of a 1st year of a master's degree in Cognitive Sciences in Nancy for the year 2022/2023. 

The goal was to complete several achievements:
* Give the whole cartography of the board to the robot
* Write instructions to calibrate the robot to detect colors
* Make the robot travel to a case of the board
* Communicate with another robot

The project was made to use the LeJOS library which is a Java library to give instructions to LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robots.

You can find the code we implemented to succeed these achievements.
